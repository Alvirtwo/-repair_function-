repair_function content:


[repair_function] (contains the following planned functions)
	[server_check] (checks for error Jobs in DB's and seperates all found errors to different subtasks)
	[subtask(x)] (divides the errors found from [server_check], where x stands for the Job ID)
	[repair_function_log] (documents all steps made by [repair_function] and exports [server_check_detail] into [repair_function_log.txt]
	[server_check_detail] (the detail of an error Job)
	[specific_repair_action_log]
	[specific_error] (Server Waiting or Pending{with subcategories})
	[specific_repair_action_confirmation] (approves [specific_repair_action] to be executed)
	[specific_repair_action] (assigned to each [specific_error])
	[responsible] (usually Service Managers/Owners)
	[engineer] (Server Administrators/Supports)

===============================
repair_function concept:


[server_check] sequencer(interval = 01:00)
	run [repair_function_log]

if detecting [specific_error] 
|	then send [repair_function_log] and [specific_repair_action_confirmation] to [responsible] and [engineer]
|		if [specific_repair_action_confirmation] = yes
|		|	then send [specific_repair_action_confirmation] to [engineer]
|		|		if [specific_repair_action_confirmation] from [engineer] = yes	
|		|		|	then run [specific_repair_action]
|		|		|		if [specific_repair_action] finished
|		|		|       then send [repair_function_log] to [responsible] and [engineer]
|		|		|
|		|		if [confirmation] from [engineer] = no
|		|	send [repair_function_log] to [engineer] (for validation)
|		|
|		if [confirmation] = no 
|			send [repair_function_log] to [engineer] (for validation)
|
if no [specific_error] do no further action()			

===============================

repair_function expected requironments:

MySQL 			[connection to the necessary databases(to get errors out of Commvault), 
			access the machines through Teampass(to run the specific_repair_action on the regarding), 
			and to send the reports and confirmation requests via Outlook]

SMTP/IMAP		[to send the mail notification/confirmation request
(PyzMail)		{solve if it is possible to send a confirmation into a program so it receives it}]

compiler		[tool for analyzing Python source code and generating Python bytecode]
test environment	[for example Selenium - Open Source]
pip			[standard package-management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python]
multithreading		[to run several threads at once]
GUI automation		[to access specific sections inside programs]
(PyAutoGUI) 		https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (research fps/latency and mouse/keyboard place analyzation{})

functions		[to create the functions]
def			[to define the functions]
class 		  	[to define the classes]
function return value	[to return a value from a function]
function recursion	[to let the function call itself]

while			[to create a while loop]
while break		[to break out of the while loop]
loop through list item	[to loop through the items in a list]

Popen()			[to start other programs]
poll()			[to check if code finished running]
wait()			[to wait for the code to finish]
cron()			[to schedule tasks{Linux}]
webbrowser.open()	[to open websites]
subprocess.Popen()	[to open subprocesses]
input()			[to enter passwords without being tracked in the cmd line history{instead of Popen}]
time.sleep()		[to set a timer for the possibility of "ctrl-c" canceling the repair_function / 
			setting back the state of a vm to before the repair_function was run, confirmed by responsible/engineer]

dict() 		     	[to return a dictionary (Array)]
dir()		        [to return a list of the specified object's properties and methods]

regex	              	[specific to match error cases]

eval()			[to evaluate and execute an expression] X
exec()			[to execute the specified code (or object)] X

format()		[to formate a specified value]
lstrip()		[to keep it compact (returns a left trim version of the string)]
string concatenation  	[to keep it compact (combines strings]

setattr()		[to set an attribute (property/method) of an object]
insert()		[to add an element at the specified position]

read()	             	[to return the file content]


(Note that I am not yet familiar with all functions an still in research mode)
